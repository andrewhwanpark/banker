Lab 3: Andrew Park (hp1141)


To compile: javac lab3.java
To run: java lab3 input-file-name

Example: java lab3 input-01


The program MUST have the input-# files in the same working directory as the .java file.


If the input files are in a subdirectory within the working directory, then the program will not detect them.


The limit for T & R is Integer.MAX_VALUE in Java. Thus, if T or R is larger than that value, the program will abort and print error.
